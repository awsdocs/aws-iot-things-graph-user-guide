# Modeling Entities<a name="iot-tg-modelmanagement"></a>

This section describes how to create and work with the entities that compose a workflow \(flow\) after you create them in the Things Data Model \(TDM\)\. 

Entities compose a workflow \(flow\)\. Entities include [Properties](iot-tg-models-tdm-propertytype.html), [States](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-state.html), [Events](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-event.html), [Actions](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-action.html), [Capabilities](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-capability.html), [Mappings](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-mapping.html), [Devices](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-device.html), and [Services](iot-tg-models-tdm-iot-service.html)\. 

After you create these entities in TDM, you upload them to your namespace by using the `UploadEntityDefinitions` API\.

For complete example device models and services, see [Example Device and Service Definitions](iot-tg-examples.html)\.
